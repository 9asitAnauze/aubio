Intel Fortran Compiler (ifx), a new, LLVM-based compilerthat comes with full Fortran 2018 support. It also supports the majority of OpenMP 5.0/5.1 including offload to Intel GPUs.ifx can also offload do concurrent to Intel GPUs.
 
The current version of Intel oneAPI is available for free, and support can be purchased.Currently the ifx compiler supports Linux and Windows platforms for x86-64 architectures. ifort supports Linux, Windows, and macOS.Community support is available for the free version at the Intel Developer forum.Optionally, you can purchase Priority Support with additional benefits including access to previous versions of ifort and ifx.
 
The latest NAG Fortran Compilerrelease (7.0) has extensive support for legacy and modern Fortran features including parallel programming with coarrays, as well as additional support for programming with OpenMP.

The Compiler also provides significant support for Fortran 2018 (atomicoperations, events and tasks, plus other smaller features), almost all ofFortran 2008, complete coverage of Fortran 2003, and all of OpenMP 3.1. Allplatforms include supporting tools for software development: source filepolishers, dependency generator for module and include files, call-graphgenerator, interface builder and a precision unifier.
 
The NVIDIA HPC SDK C, C++, and Fortran compilers, former PGI compilers, support GPU acceleration of HPC modeling and simulation applications with standard C++ and Fortran, OpenACC directives, and CUDA. GPU-accelerated math libraries maximize performance on common HPC algorithms, and optimized communications libraries enable standards-based multi-GPU and scalable systems programming.
 
The AMD Optimizing C/C++ Compiler (AOCC)compiler system is a high performance, production quality code generation tool.The AOCC environment provides various options to developers when building andoptimizing C, C++, and Fortran applications targeting 32-bit and 64-bit Linuxplatforms. The AOCC compiler system offers a high level of advancedoptimizations, multi-threading and processor support that includes globaloptimization, vectorization, inter-procedural analyses, loop transformations,and code generation. AMD also provides highly optimized libraries, which extractthe optimal performance from each x86 processor core when utilized. The AOCCCompiler Suite simplifies and accelerates development and tuning for x86applications.
 
Build and optimize oneAPI multiarchitecture applications using the latest Intel-optimized oneAPI and AI tools, and test your workloads across Intel CPUs and GPUs. No hardware installations, software downloads, or configuration necessary.
 
This code sample demonstrates how to build and run a serial implementation of a Monte Carlo program, and then convert it to run in parallel using Fortran coarrays, providing hands-on experience with the Fortran coarray feature for parallel programming.
 
The OpenMP Primes code sample demonstrates how to use the OpenMP API with Intel Fortran Compiler to find prime numbers, including the count of specific types of primes. This is done by using two OpenMP directives to enhance code performance, providing practical insight into building and running Fortran OpenMP applications.
 
The Matrix Multiply code sample offers a guided process to adapt a basic Fortran program for offloading computations to an Intel GPU using OpenMP directives with the Intel Fortran Compiler. It focuses on a simple matrix multiplication algorithm to demonstrate the use of OpenMP directives in Fortran for GPU offloading.
 
This repository contains a Jupyter\* Notebook created for illustrating OpenMP offload basics, focusing on the process of offloading intricate calculations to a GPU using OpenMP with the Intel Fortran Compiler, providing comprehensive insights into GPU offloading with OpenMP.

The purpose of the GNU Fortran (GFortran) project is todevelop the Fortran compiler front end and run-time librariesfor GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection. GFortran development is partof the GNU Project. We seek to bringfree number crunching to a broad spectrum of platforms and users.
 
In particular, the project wishes to reach users of theFortran language, be it in the scientific community, education, or commercial environments. The GFortran compiler is fully compliantwith the Fortran 95 Standard and includes legacy F77 support.In addition, a significant number of Fortran 2003 and Fortran 2008features are implemented. Please give it a try. If you encounter problems,contact us at the mailing list or file a problem report.
 
GFortran development follows the open development process. We dothis to attract a diverse team of developers and to ensure that GFortranworks on multiple architectures and diverse environments. We always needmore help. If you are interested in participating, please contact us atfortran@gcc.gnu.org.(Also check out our mailing lists page.)
 
The GNU Project is about providing source code for its programs. For convenience, a number of people regularly build binaries for different platforms. Links to these can be found at the wiki. Most of the binary executables are the latest development snapshots of GFortran and areprovided to encourage testing. We also want new users, from studentsto masters of the art of Fortran, to try GFortran.It really is a great compiler!
 
The initial goal of the GNU Fortran Project was construction of aFortran 95 compiler that complies with the ISO Fortran 95 ProgrammingLanguage standard [ISO/IEC 1539-1:1997(E)]. We are now well intoF2003 and F2008 features.The GFortranwiki and our bug trackerlist features under development or yet to be implemented. Compilercapability is quite extensive and includes nearly all g77 features.We highly encourage users to move from g77, which is no longermaintained, and start taking advantage of GFortran's modern features.Legacy g77 code will compile fine in almost all cases.
 
Intel Fortran Compiler Classic (ifort) is now deprecated and will be discontinued in late 2024. Intel recommends that customers transition now to using the LLVM-based Intel Fortran Compiler (ifx) for continued Windows\* and Linux\* support, new language support, new language features, and optimizations.
 
When you try IFX, make sure it is a minumum of version 2023.2.0. Nothing older. The older the IFX compiler, the higher the probability of encountering a bug particularly with codes with modern F2018 features.
 
You have a good approach: validate a tools stack at a particular Windows version and VS version and Intel compiler version. Use that stack without updates or changes. Then pick a second stack with the latest from MS and Intel and validate that stack to use in future releases of your application. The reason I mentioned avoiding updates is that VS updates have broken our integrations twice in the past year or so. As you know, VS is pushing out updates almost every month and all of us struggle to keep up without breaking our stacks.
 
Hi Franklin. Welcome to the Fortran Discourse. VS Code is ultimately a code editor. It does not come with any compilers. There are extensions like fortls that help with writing code but, you would need to install a compiler in addition to VS Code to build your codes.
 
I have read and followed this answer to install scipy/numpy/theano. However, it still failed on the same error of missing Fortran compiler after brew install gcc. While HomeBrew installed the gcc-4.8, it didn't install any gfortran or g95 commands. I figure gfortran may be just a synonymy of gcc, then I create a symlink
 
For Arch Linux, you'll need to install core/gcc-fortran, although I realized that I could just change the version of scipy in my requirements.txt file to the newest version available to fix the issue, too.
 
There is a trial NAG Fortran compiler for Apple Silicon (ARM) Macs. It is not free, I don't use it, and you will need to talk with NAG about any limitations it may have on M1/2/3 Macs and associated library compatibility. It is my understanding that GNU is not targeting their Fortran development for Apple Silicon Macs.
 
GNU Fortran (GFortran) is excellent on Apple Silicon. Easily installed via Homebrew (brew.sh) at the command line. I do all of my Fortran development and testing on Apple Silicon, before moving to Linux AMD and Intel clusters. It follows all the same/usual standards, is kept updated with the current version, and the performance per core is brilliant.
 
Thank you for the excellent information regarding GNU Fortran compiling platform. I'm a newbie at code writing and compiling and I apologize for asking this, but where do I get the GNU Fortran compiling binaries? I am using Apple M1 and M2 Silicon and am really in need of a Fortran compiler to compile the molecular dynamics software code, AMBER. Any information you can provide to help would be very thankfully received.
